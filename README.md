# MovieDB-school-project
simple not fully functional school project

Vision

My Vision while creating this app was to create a small Android app which displays the information of movies. 
These movies are saved within a database or will be requested by an “API” service, which at the time of writing, still needs to be implemented. 
The user should also be able to make his own entries into the app. These movies will instantly be displayed in the corresponding genre-movie-list. 
This app will be constructed in multiple iterations. We focused on simplicity and with the least amount of unnecessary code
